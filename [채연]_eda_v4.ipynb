         "Digg is a user driven social content website. Everything on Digg is user-submitted. After you submit content, other people read your submission and \"Digg\" what they like best. If your story receives enough Diggs, it's promoted to the front page for other visitors to see.\n\n[Kevin Rose](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/kevin-rose) came up with the idea for Digg in the fall of 2004.  He found programmer [Owen Byrne](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-byrne) through [eLance](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/elance) and paid him $10/hour to develop the idea. In addition, Rose paid $99 per month for hosting and $1,200 for the Digg.com domain. In December of 2004, Kevin launched his creation to the world through a post on his blog.\n\nIn February of 2005, Paris Hilton's cell phone was hacked.  Images and phone numbers from the phone were posted online and it didn't take long for a user to post the link on Digg. The rapidshare downloads site started to receive an enormous amount of traffic and it was then, Rose says, he saw \"the power of breaking stories before anyone else.\"\n\nDigg has been a force ever since.  Acquisition offers have been made, Rose was on the cover of [BusinessWeek](/company/businessweek) and according to [Alexa](/company/alexa), Digg is in the top 100 most trafficked sites on the internet. The success hasn't come without its share of problems though.  The site has had to face [services aimed at gaming](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/04/02/subvert-and-profit-next-service-to-try-gaming-digg/) the way stories hit the front page, as well as a [user revolt](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/05/01/digg-surrenders-to-mob/).  Digg has however been able to get over these hurdles as it continues to be one of the social news leaders. ",

         "Facebook is the world's largest social network, with over [1.15 billion monthly active users](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/).\n\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg) in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [Chris Hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [Eduardo Saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. \n\nThe original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.\n\nWith this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to [Palo Alto](/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [Napster](/company/napster), [Sean Parker](/person/sean-parker). Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [Peter Thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [PayPal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [The Founders Fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. \n\nWith millions more users, [Friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. \n \nIn the summer of 2006, [Yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [Reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [Viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. \n\nNot long after, in October 2007, [Microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the [5th most valuable US Internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.\n\nFacebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/).\n\nOne sour note for Facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). \n\nNotwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook's growth has been staggering. Facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\n\nFacebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _The Social Network_ was released which chronicled Facebook's inception.\n\nIn its 2012 [IPO filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users.",

         "Facebook is the world's largest social network, with over [1.15 billion monthly active users](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/).\n\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg) in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [Chris Hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [Eduardo Saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. \n\nThe original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.\n\nWith this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to [Palo Alto](/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [Napster](/company/napster), [Sean Parker](/person/sean-parker). Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [Peter Thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [PayPal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [The Founders Fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. \n\nWith millions more users, [Friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. \n \nIn the summer of 2006, [Yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [Reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [Viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. \n\nNot long after, in October 2007, [Microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the [5th most valuable US Internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.\n\nFacebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/).\n\nOne sour note for Facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). \n\nNotwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook's growth has been staggering. Facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\n\nFacebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _The Social Network_ was released which chronicled Facebook's inception.\n\nIn its 2012 [IPO filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users.",

         "facebook is the world's largest social network, with over [1.15 billion monthly active users](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/). facebook was founded by [mark zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg) in february 2004, initially as an exclusive network for harvard students. it was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the boston area began demanding a facebook network. zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [dustin moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [chris hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [eduardo saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build facebook, and within four months, facebook added 30 more college networks. the original idea for the term facebook came from zuckerberg's high school (phillips exeter academy). the exeter face book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. it was a physical paper book until zuckerberg brought it to the internet. with this success, zuckerberg, moskowitz and hughes moved out to [palo alto](/maps/city/palo%2520alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. a few weeks later, zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [napster](/company/napster), [sean parker](/person/sean-parker). parker soon moved in to zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together. parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [peter thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [paypal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [the founders fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). thiel invested $500,000 into facebook. with millions more users, [friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [accel partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in september 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. the next spring, facebook received $25 million in funding from [greylock partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [meritech capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors accel partners and peter thiel. the pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. finally in september 2006, facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. in the summer of 2006, [yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell facebook to yahoo. a few days later when yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and zuckerberg walked away from the deal. yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time zuckerberg turned yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. this was not the first time zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in march 2006. not long after, in october 2007, [microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. this meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making facebook the [5th most valuable us internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. many explained microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid google. facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in january 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. a year later, in february 2012, facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. the company went public on may 18, 2012, opening on the nasdaq with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/). one sour note for facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network connectu. the founders of connectu, former classmates of mark zuckerberg at harvard, allege that zuckerberg stole their original source code for facebook. the ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). notwithstanding this lingering controversy, facebook's growth has been staggering. facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in february 2012 upon filing for its ipo. as of july 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. mobile users now make up half of facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion likes and comments per day. facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the us, and its international growth has been impressive. additionally, facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. facebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on facebook. the site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _the social network_ was released which chronicled facebook's inception. in its 2012 [ipo filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users",

         "Facebook is the world's largest social network, with over [1.15 billion monthly active users](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/).\n\nFacebook was founded by [Mark Zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg) in February 2004, initially as an exclusive network for Harvard students. It was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the Boston area began demanding a Facebook network. Zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [Dustin Moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [Chris Hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [Eduardo Saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build Facebook, and within four months, Facebook added 30 more college networks. \n\nThe original idea for the term Facebook came from Zuckerberg's high school (Phillips Exeter Academy). The Exeter Face Book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. It was a physical paper book until Zuckerberg brought it to the internet.\n\nWith this success, Zuckerberg, Moskowitz and Hughes moved out to [Palo Alto](/maps/city/Palo%2520Alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. A few weeks later, Zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [Napster](/company/napster), [Sean Parker](/person/sean-parker). Parker soon moved in to Zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together.  Parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [Peter Thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [PayPal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [The Founders Fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). Thiel invested $500,000 into Facebook. \n\nWith millions more users, [Friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. Facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [Accel Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). Facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in September 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. The next spring, Facebook received $25 million in funding from [Greylock Partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [Meritech Capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors Accel Partners and Peter Thiel. The pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. Facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. Finally in September 2006, Facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. \n \nIn the summer of 2006, [Yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [Reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that Zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell Facebook to Yahoo. A few days later when Yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and Zuckerberg walked away from the deal.  Yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time Zuckerberg turned Yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. This was not the first time Zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [Viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in March 2006. \n\nNot long after, in October 2007, [Microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into Facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. This meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making Facebook the [5th most valuable US Internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. Many explained Microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid Google.\n\nFacebook continued to receive funding, most notably in January 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. A year later, in February 2012, Facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. The company went public on May 18, 2012, opening on the NASDAQ with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/).\n\nOne sour note for Facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network ConnectU. The founders of ConnectU, former classmates of Mark Zuckerberg at Harvard, allege that Zuckerberg stole their original source code for Facebook. The ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). \n\nNotwithstanding this lingering controversy, Facebook's growth has been staggering. Facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in February 2012 upon filing for its IPO. As of July 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into Facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. Mobile users now make up half of Facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. Facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion Likes and Comments per day. Facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the US, and its international growth has been impressive. Additionally, Facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day.\n\nFacebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on Facebook. The site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _The Social Network_ was released which chronicled Facebook's inception.\n\nIn its 2012 [IPO filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), Facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users.",

         "facebook is the world's largest social network, with over [1.15 billion monthly active users](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/). facebook was founded by [mark zuckerberg](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/mark-zuckerberg) in february 2004, initially as an exclusive network for harvard students. it was a huge hit: in 2 weeks, half of the schools in the boston area began demanding a facebook network. zuckerberg immediately recruited his friends [dustin moskovitz](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/dustin-moskovitz), [chris hughes](/person/chris-hughes), and [eduardo saverin](/person/eduardo-saverin) to help build facebook, and within four months, facebook added 30 more college networks. the original idea for the term facebook came from zuckerberg's high school (phillips exeter academy). the exeter face book was passed around to every student as a way for students to get to know their classmates for the following year. it was a physical paper book until zuckerberg brought it to the internet. with this success, zuckerberg, moskowitz and hughes moved out to [palo alto](/maps/city/palo%2520alto) for the summer and rented a sublet. a few weeks later, zuckerberg ran into the former cofounder of [napster](/company/napster), [sean parker](/person/sean-parker). parker soon moved in to zuckerberg's apartment and they began working together. parker provided the introduction to their first investor, [peter thiel](/person/peter-thiel), cofounder of [paypal](/company/paypal) and managing partner of [the founders fund](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/founders-fund). thiel invested $500,000 into facebook. with millions more users, [friendster](/company/friendster) [attempted](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) to acquire the company for $10 million in mid 2004. facebook turned down the offer and subsequently received $12.7 million in funding from [accel partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/accel-partners), at a valuation of [around $100 million](http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/09/07/85-of-college-students-use-facebook/). facebook continued to grow, opening up to high school students in september 2005 and adding an immensely popular photo sharing feature the next month. the next spring, facebook received $25 million in funding from [greylock partners](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/greylock) and [meritech capital](http://www.crunchbase.com/financial-organization/meritech-capital-partners), as well as previous investors accel partners and peter thiel. the pre-money valuation for this deal was about $525 million. facebook subsequently [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/04/26/facebook-goes-beyond-college-high-school-markets/) up to work networks, eventually amassing over 20,000 work networks. finally in september 2006, facebook [opened](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/26/facebook-just-launched-open-registrations/) to anyone with an email address. in the summer of 2006, [yahoo](/company/yahoo) [attempted to acquire](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/21/facebook-and-yahoo-in-acquisition-talks-for-1-billion/) the company for $1 billion dollars. [reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell facebook to yahoo. a few days later when yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and zuckerberg walked away from the deal. yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time zuckerberg turned yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. this was not the first time zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in march 2006. not long after, in october 2007, [microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. this meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making facebook the [5th most valuable us internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. many explained microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid google. facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in january 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. a year later, in february 2012, facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. the company went public on may 18, 2012, opening on the nasdaq with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/). one sour note for facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network connectu. the founders of connectu, former classmates of mark zuckerberg at harvard, allege that zuckerberg stole their original source code for facebook. the ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). notwithstanding this lingering controversy, facebook's growth has been staggering. facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in february 2012 upon filing for its ipo. as of july 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. mobile users now make up half of facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion likes and comments per day. facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the us, and its international growth has been impressive. additionally, facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. facebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on facebook. the site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _the social network_ was released which chronicled facebook's inception. in its 2012 [ipo filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users",

[reports](http://www.wired.com/techbiz/startups/news/2007/09/ff_facebook) actually indicated that zuckerberg made a verbal agreement to sell facebook to yahoo. a few days later when yahoo's stock price took a dive, the offer was lowered to $800 million and zuckerberg walked away from the deal. yahoo later [offered](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/12/yahoos-project-fraternity-docs-leaked/) $1 billion again, this time zuckerberg turned yahoo down and earned instant notoriety as the \"kid\" who turned down a billion. this was not the first time zuckerberg turned down an acquisition offer; [viacom](/company/viacom) had previously [unsuccessfully](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/03/28/facebook-is-doing-the-skype-dance/) attempted to acquire the company for $750 million in march 2006. not long after, in october 2007, [microsoft invested](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/24/facebook-takes-the-microsoft-money-and-runs/) $240 million into facebook for 1.6 percent of the company in. this meant a valuation of over $15 billion, making facebook the [5th most valuable us internet company](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/25/perspective-facebook-is-now-5th-most-valuable-us-internet-company/), yet with only $150 million in annual revenue. many explained microsoft's decision as being solely driven by the desire to outbid google. facebook continued to receive funding, most notably in january 2011 receiving a [$1.5 billion round](http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/21/facebook-raises-1-5-billion-at-50-billion-valuation/), valuing the company at $50 billion. a year later, in february 2012, facebook [announced](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/) that it was filing for its long-anticipated initial public offering. the company went public on may 18, 2012, opening on the nasdaq with shares trading at [$42.05](http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/18/facebook-share-open-10-5-higher-at-42/). one sour note for facebook has been the [controversy](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/16/the-ghost-of-zuckerbergs-past-may-haunt-facebook-ipo/) with social network connectu. the founders of connectu, former classmates of mark zuckerberg at harvard, allege that zuckerberg stole their original source code for facebook. the ordeal has [gone to court](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/10/10/facebook-vs-connectu-facebook-makes-untrue-assertions-claims-connectu/), and has now been [resolved](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/22/after-seven-years-the-winklevosses-give-up-on-battle-with-facebook/). notwithstanding this lingering controversy, facebook's growth has been staggering. facebook announced [astonishing numbers](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebooks-s-1-845-million-users-every-month-more-than-half-daily-and-nearly-half-mobile/) in february 2012 upon filing for its ipo. as of july 2013, over [1.15 billion](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/24/facebook-growth-2/) users log into facebook every month, and 669 million users log in daily. mobile users now make up half of facebook's user base, with 819 million monthly actives. facebook has also announced that by the end of 2011 there had been 100 billion friend connections, and in recent months users had been registering 2.7 billion likes and comments per day. facebook is one of the [most trafficked sites](http://techcrunch.com/2010/12/29/hitwise-facebook-overtakes-google-to-become-most-visited-website-in-2010/) in the us, and its international growth has been impressive. additionally, facebook is the top photo sharing site with 250 million photos uploaded per day. facebook users' [passion](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/13/i-just-cant-be-a-college-student-without-facebook/)or [addiction](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/03/09/career-advice-dont-choose-facebook-over-your-job/)to the site is unparalleled: more than half use the product every single day and users spend an average of 19 minutes a day on facebook. the site's popularity has garnered it pop culture fame, so much so that in 2010 a feature film entitled _the social network_ was released which chronicled facebook's inception. in its 2012 [ipo filing](http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/01/facebook-files-for-5-billion-ipo/), facebook announced that it intends to grow in the near future by expanding its global user base, increasing engagement by developing new social tools, improving the mobile experience, and creating more value for advertisers and users",

The service is free, however, there are video advertisements interspersed between and during programs as well as small type or image ads on the sides of your screen.\n\nWith very heavy backing from media giants CBS and Viacom, Joost looks good to take on competitors [Bablegum](http://crunchbase.com/company/bablegum) and [Microsoft LiveStation](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/06/first-look-at-livestation-not-much-to-report/).  Currently Joost has content deals with CNN, the NHL and Sony as well as their financiers CBS and Viacom (MTV, Comedy Central etc). They have also [recently](http://www.joost.com/forums/p/2007/08/widget-api/) developed a new Widget API open to third parties to make their own Joost widgets. \n\nUnlike many online video platforms, joost does require a download and cannot play video directly from users' browsers.  joost offers a desktop client that allows the user to watch on-demand TV over the internet. In addition, Joost enhances the TV experience by offering interactive tools. For example, users will be able to chat with friends while watching a show. The channels will also have interactive displays where users can discover behind-the-scene content.\n\nJoost's peer-to-peer technology also lowers the cost of channel owners by reducing the amount of data the servers must stream out. joost only serves some selected users, while the rest of the data is distributed from user to user.  \n\nRumor has it that Joost is in talks with hardware manufacturers to [embed](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/15/embedded-joost-will-change-the-market/) its platform into TV set-top boxes. If the move were successful it could change the TV industry substantially.\n\nJoost is now fully public and open to all.\n\nUPDATE: Joost has recently deactivated it's software client and now streams it's entire catalog via Adobe's Flash Player which is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.",
